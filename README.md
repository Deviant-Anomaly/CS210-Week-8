# CS210-Week-8
  Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

- For this project, we had to make an interest calculator app for AirGead Banking. The goal was to make a calculator that calculated interest after an initial deposit, both with and without additional monthly deposits.
- The user selected the initial deposit amount, the rate of interest, and a set monthly deposit amount. 
  
  What did you do particularly well?

- I feel like I did best with the user inputs, and I was very proud of myself for using the system("cls") function, and how I incorporated it into my user choice cases.
I also feel I did better with seperating what goes into .cpp and .h files, as in Project 1 I was still trying to figure it out.
 
  Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

- I'm sure if I dig through I may have a few redundant lines of code somewhere, or maybe lines that don't do much if anything at all. I'm sure in terms of security and maintainability I could make some changes, I know I could easily go in and do some more formatting stuff to make it more visually appealing. I struggled with defining and implementing private class members, so if I remember correctly, I only made protected and public members in my classes. 

  Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

- I think the biggest challenge for me was going through headers and trying to figure out which ones went to which function. I had to do a LOT of reading on C++ dictionary for this to try and figure out how to get the user input numbers to properly fill in the table I created. I also struggled with private class members, as in previous classes I always made everything public, so I do have to spend a bit more time working out the definitions and functions to implement private class members properly.
Not included in this project, I will be working on the reading of input files and writing to an output file, as in project 3 that absolutely did not fall into place the way I had wanted.

  What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

- I think the setfill function will be extremely valuable for me later on, and while not required for this project, reading information from one file and writing the desired information into another output file. Both of these seem like valuable ways to easily import information into your project.

  How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  
- I broke everything down into seperate .cpp and .h files to make things more readable. I have a hard time scrolling through a giant wall of text, so readability is my number one priority.
  I feel the code is fairly easy to maintain and adapt. It doesn't necessarily have to calculate interest, I could use other equations in its place to calulate other things as well.
